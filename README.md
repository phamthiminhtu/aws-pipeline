Implemented pipelines and involved stacks are shown in the image below:

This repo is still in its early stages. New features and implementation are coming.
Future implementation:
- Ingest data from other databases (Mysql, Postgres, etc.)
- dbt for data transformation
- Spark for data processing for ML  use cases
